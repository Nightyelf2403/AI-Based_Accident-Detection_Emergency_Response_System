# 🚨 AI-Based Accident Detection & Emergency Response System

This project uses advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to automatically detect road accidents in real-time through CCTV or dashcam video feeds. Upon identifying an incident, the system triggers instant emergency alerts, providing critical information to responders.

---

## 📌 Overview

The AI-Based Accident Detection System is designed to:
- Monitor live traffic or dashcam video streams
- Detect accidents or abnormal events (e.g., collisions, sudden stops)
- Alert emergency services with minimal latency
- Reduce human monitoring effort and response time

---

## 🎯 Goals

- **Accurate Detection:** Identify vehicular accidents using trained object and anomaly detection models.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Notify emergency responders instantly when an accident occurs.
- **Robustness:** Handle varying weather, lighting, and traffic conditions.
- **Evaluation:** Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and latency.

## 📦 Deliverables

- 📁 Labeled dataset of accident and non-accident videos  
- 🤖 Trained object detection models (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)  
- ⚠️ Anomaly detection models (CNN, LSTM, ViT)  
- 📊 Evaluation report with performance metrics  
- 🔧 Real-time prototype system for testing and demo
