## 📌 Overview

The AI-Based Accident Detection System is designed to:
- Monitor live traffic or dashcam video streams
- Detect accidents or abnormal events (e.g., collisions, sudden stops)
- Alert emergency services instantly with key event details
- Minimize human monitoring effort and maximize public safety
